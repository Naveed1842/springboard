# Predicting Health Code Violations In Boston Restaurants
### Springboard Capstone Project by Roy Wright, August 2016

**Overview:** The City of Boston, like many others, conducts health inspections of food service establishments in a largely random pattern of visits. With a model for predicting which of all the potential inspections will result in violations, the inspections can be carried out in a targeted way. This could make more efficient use of inspectorsâ€™ time and, more importantly, increase the chances of detecting violations. 
Herein, we develop the capability of predicting whether a health code violation would be found at a given food service establishment, if it were chosen to be inspected, without prior notice, at the moment that the predictive model is used. The main factors used in predicting an inspection outcome are the urban conditions near the restaurant in the weeks leading up to the inspection.
