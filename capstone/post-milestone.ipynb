    "# Predicting Health Code Violations in Boston\n",
    "### Capstone Milestone Report\n",
    "Roy Wright  \n",
    "June 21, 2016  \n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to find restaurants that are likely to fail an unannounced health inspection &mdash; that is, we will estimate the probability that a health code violation would be found at a given food service establishment, if it were chosen to be inspected, without prior notice, right now. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Client\n",
    "\n",
    "The City of Boston, like many others, conducts health inspections of food service establishments in a largely random pattern of visits. With a model for predicting where and when health code violations might be expected, the inspections can be carried out in a targeted way. This could make more efficient use of inspectors' time and, more importantly, increase the chances of detecting violations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Datasets\n",
    "### Health Inspections\n",
    "Detailed records of health inspections throughout Boston, from 2006 to present, can be obtained from [data.cityofboston.gov](https://data.cityofboston.gov/Health/Food-Establishment-Inspections/qndu-wx8w). Each inspection record includes the following pieces of information, among others: \n",
    "* Food service establishment's name\n",
    "* Category and type\n",
    " - category \"FS\" stands for \"Eating & Drinking\"\n",
    " - category \"FT\" stands for \"Eating & Drinking w/ Take Out\"\n",
    " - category \"MFW\" stands for \"Mobile Food Walk On\"\n",
    " - category \"RF\" stands for \"Retail Food\"\n",
    "* The result of the inspection\n",
    " - \"HE_Fail\" when an establishment's first inspection (or first yearly inspection) is unsatisfactory\n",
    " - \"HE_FailExt\" when an establishment is reinspected within a few weeks after a failure, and fails again\n",
    " - \"HE_Pass\" when an establishment passes an inspection with no violations (either its first yearly inspection or a reinspection a few weeks after failure)\n",
    " - \"HE_Filed\" for the first inspection of an opening establishment\n",
    " - other result codes are much less common\n",
    "* The date of the inspection\n",
    "* Summary and description of each violation found, along with its severity, measured as \\* or \\*\\* or \\*\\*\\*\n",
    "* Written comments\n",
    "* Business address \n",
    "* Latitude/longitude coordinates (sometimes)\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we load the data and make the following adjustments:\n",
    "* Cut off any records before August 1, 2011, because one of our other datasets does not extend back farther than this\n",
    "* Separate the latitude/longitude coordinates for later use\n",
    "* Process address information into a form that could more easily be used to look up latitude/longitude coordinates where they are missing\n",
    "\n",
    "A portion of some randomly-selected lines of the inspections data is shown."

    "There seem to be some mistakes in Yelp's condensed records. To see why, note that in the city records above, the inspection of Samurai Kuang Eatery on August 12 is marked as passing. For that inspection, four 1-star and one 3-star violations are noted, but this is only because that inspection was a follow-up to an inspection from one week before, which found those violations. This can be seen in the excerpt of city data below. Unfortunately, the Yelp data treats each of these inspections identically, marking four 1-star and one 3-star violations for each inspection, which is quite misleading. This mistaken double-entry of health violations happens frequently throughout the Yelp dataset. \n",

    "Yelp's dataset was developed with the express support of the City of Boston, working toward a purpose very similar to the purpose of the present project. This dataset provides latitude/longitude coordinates for every inspection location listed. Also, Yelp's inspection records are designed for easy matching to another extensive dataset (not yet shown here) containing the text of Yelp reviews for each establishment.\n",

    "## Extracting Features from the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "To develop a model for predicting a food service establishment's likely outcome (pass or fail) from an unannounced health inspection, we will make use of two main types of information:\n",
    "* Conditions in the area near the business in the recent past, as drawn from the service call request data outlined above.\n",
    "* Customer impressions of the business, as given in Yelp ratings and written reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Yelp dataset of inspection results already has some basic features drawn from customer impressions. These are the number of reviews, and the average customer rating for each establishment. These features are flawed in a few ways, perhaps most importantly in that they are summarized over all time (rather than just up to the date of inspection), so we will eventually replace them with better features drawn from the deeper Yelp review data available. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the code below, we extract potential features related to conditions in the area near each inspected business in the recent past. For each of the common service call \"reasons\" discussed before, we count the number of times that particular issue has been reported near the inspected business, between 5 and 15 days before the inspection. Nearness is judged here in terms of distance in latitude/longitude coordinates; roughly speaking, we are counting any reports that have occurred within about 3 miles of the inspected business. *(The time window and distance used here were chosen after some light experimentation, but can be further adjusted for better predictive ability.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "For each business inspected, we also measure the length of time that has passed since the previous inspection."

    "Below, for demonstration purposes, we display the information for inspections that occurred on July 22, 2014. With these we can illustrate the meaning of the features extracted above. For example, an inspection occurred at Penguin Pizza that day. This inspection was failed, since violations were found. Between 5 and 15 days prior to this inspection, there were 499 complaints related to \"sanitation\" in the area around Pengin Pizza, 325 complaints related to \"highway maintenance,\" 104 related  to \"street cleaning,\" and so on. It had been 208 days since Penguin Pizza's last inspection. \n",
    "\n",
    "Farther down in the table below, we see that Rebecca's Cafe was inspected the same day, and passed (no violations). 5 to 15 days prior to this inspection, there were 452 complaints related to \"sanitation\" in the area around Rebecca's Cafe, 297 complaints related to \"highway maintenance,\" and so forth. \n",
    "\n",
    "Observe that the \"delay\" column, which marks the number of days that have passed since each establishment was last inspected, contains numbers of two very distinct magnitudes. This reflects the fact that many inspections are follow-ups to recent failed inspections. As shown before, the violations information given for these follow-ups is often not accurate."

    "Returning to the table of correlation coefficients above, on the far right side of the table we see that the average customer rating for establishments is somewhat negatively correlated with the number of violations found, which is not surprising. However, we alse see a stronger negative correlation between the \"delay\" (the length of time that has passed since the last inspection) and the number of violations found. This indicates that the more time has passed since the last inspection, the fewer violations are found &mdash; or in other words, establishments are most likely to be in violation of health codes shortly after their last inspection. This seems nonsensical; indeed, it is merely an artifact of the \"mistaken double-entry of health violations\" that was pointed out before.\n",

    "Fortunately, the goal of this project gives us ample justification for ignoring any data from follow-up inspections. We seek a model for identifying businesses that are likely to fail an **unannounced** health inspection. Any business that has already failed a recent inspection will necessarily be inspected again, regardless of any prediction we might make about the outcome of that follow-up. So in the context of this project, there is no value to the City of Boston in predicting the outcomes of follow-up inspections. Therefore in the remaining analysis, we will exclude any data from follow-up inspections, focusing solely on the outcomes of inspections that were not expected in advance.\n",
